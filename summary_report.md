📊 EDA on Obesity & Lifestyle — Summary Report
🗂️ Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to obesity and lifestyle factors. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that help us understand how lifestyle choices impact obesity levels.

📌 Dataset

Description: The dataset contains features like gender, age, height, weight, calorie intake, physical activity levels, and habits like smoking or alcohol consumption.

Objective: To analyze how different lifestyle factors contribute to obesity.

⚙️ Steps Performed
Data Collection & Loading

Imported required Python libraries.

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Checked shape, columns, and basic info.

Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values and handled them.

Fixed incorrect or inconsistent entries.

Converted data types if required.

Univariate Analysis

Plotted distribution of numerical features (age, weight, height, BMI).

Visualized categorical variables (gender, smoking, activity level).

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Plotted correlations between BMI and other lifestyle factors.

Used heatmaps, scatter plots, and pair plots to study relationships.

Insights & Findings

Identified trends like higher obesity levels linked to low physical activity.

Noted significant differences in obesity trends across genders and age groups.

Found possible outliers in height and weight.

Visualization

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for clean, clear plots.

Visualized BMI distribution across categories.

Boxplots and histograms helped detect skewness and outliers.

Key Insights
Sedentary lifestyle and high-calorie intake strongly correlate with higher BMI.

Regular physical activity and balanced diet reduce obesity risk.

Some demographic groups (e.g., middle-aged adults) showed higher obesity prevalence.

✅ Conclusion
This EDA highlights critical lifestyle factors influencing obesity. These insights can support public health policies or guide further predictive modeling (e.g., building an obesity risk prediction model).

Great. Please provide:

✅ 1. Your specific EDA findings
Copy-paste or summarise the actual insights you obtained in your notebook or .py scripts, such as:

Did you observe any BMI distribution ranges or class imbalances?

What correlations were strong or negligible?

Any interesting outliers (e.g. height <100 cm or >200 cm, extremely low BMI)?

Gender-wise or age-group-wise differences?

✅ 2. Any graphs or visualizations you want referenced in the report
For example:

“BMI vs Age scatter plot showed linear trend.”

“Pie chart of obesity classes showed majority in normal weight class.”

✅ 3. Your dataset source link (e.g. Kaggle dataset URL) if you want it cited in the report.
