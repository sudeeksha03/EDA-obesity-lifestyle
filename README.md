📝 Project Description
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to obesity and lifestyle factors. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that influence obesity levels, supporting future work in health analytics, machine learning, and public health recommendations.

🔍 Problem Statement
Obesity is a critical global health challenge. Understanding how factors such as diet, physical activity, and habits affect obesity is essential for designing targeted interventions and awareness programs.

📂 Dataset
Features:

Demographics: Gender, Age, Height, Weight

Lifestyle habits: Calorie intake, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption

Calculated BMI and obesity class labels

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for workflow

🚀 Project Workflow
Data Loading & Inspection

Loaded the dataset into Pandas DataFrame.

Checked data types, shape, and basic statistics.

Data Cleaning

Identified and handled missing values.

Managed outliers for height, weight, and BMI.

Encoded categorical variables where needed.

Univariate Analysis

Explored individual feature distributions.

Visualized age, BMI, calorie intake using histograms and count plots.

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Examined correlations between BMI and lifestyle factors.

Visualized using scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmaps.

Insights & Findings

Identified lifestyle habits strongly linked with higher BMI.

Found gender-wise and age-wise differences in obesity prevalence.

Detected possible outliers requiring data validation.

Visualization

Created meaningful plots for data story-telling and clear communication of insights.

🔑 Key Insights
High-calorie intake combined with low physical activity is significantly associated with higher obesity levels.

Sedentary lifestyle contributes greatly to obesity risk.

Gender differences observed in BMI distribution, indicating targeted intervention needs.

Age group 30-50 showed higher prevalence of obesity compared to other groups.
